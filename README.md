# Project name to be determined
Final Computer Graphics project. Written in C++ and uses OpenGL and GLUT graphics and I/O libraries.<br>
By Owen Gallagher and Brian Park

# Initial project ideas
__Flight horizon__: A ship is flying infinitely forward and is dodging obstacles or shooting enemies or something like that.

__Globe trotter__: Like flight horizon, but on a small spherical planet instead of a flat plane. Rendering shadows probably won't be possible.

__\*Gun fight\*__: Top-down shooter with a mechanic like Super Hot. Cursor aiming may be a challenge (draw a ray from the camera through the cursor's projection in front of it)

__Tall jump__: Like Doodle Jump, rendered in 3D but the action mostly takes place in the xy plane.
